Here are some words written by Skirple, the owner, that describe our game!

## GAME DESCRIPTION:
>Orangutan Atrocity is a VR game built on Unity and Blender assets. In Orangutan Atrocity, you can run around a big forest with trees, slides, and more! Or, you could adventure to the forest-floor, and enter the various maps offered below the main floor! Our most noteable maps include but are by no means limited to: Horror, The Shug Zone, The Studio, and of course, The Forest! You can also collect an ingame currency called "Sticks" and trade this currency for Cosmetics (Holdables, Badges, Hats, Masks, and more!)
